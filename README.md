# Self-organizing transport modeller

Self-organizing transoprt modeller (SOTM) is a library for modelling different physical processes based on dynamic graphs in space. The project was created to model lightning discharge but may be applied to other physical processes.

Currently project is at an early stage of development so it couldn't be used in any production simulations
